# Houston V3 (WIP)
Updated version of Houston that aims to (eventually) add functionality to graph only subsets of live data based on user selection and implement some check to detect when producer-consumer pipeline queue is filling up faster than it is being processed.

## How to Use
### Building the Code
You can compile this project on Windows, macOS, or Linux using the terminal. Ensure you have CMake and a C++ compiler (like GCC, Clang, or MSVC) installed.

Run the following command to generate the build files. This creates a build/ directory and checks your system for the necessary graphics and communication libraries.  
```cmake -B build -S .```.  

Once the configuration is complete, run the build command. This transforms the C++ source code into a runnable executable.  
```cmake --build build -j 4```.  

### Find the ESP32 Port
Windows
* Connect the ESP32 to your computer via USB.
* Right-click the Start button and select Device Manager.
* Expand the Ports (COM & LPT) section.
* Look for "Silicon Labs CP210x" or "USB-SERIAL CH340".
* Your port will look like: COM3.

macOS
* Open the Terminal.
* Run the command: ls /dev/cu.*
* Look for a device containing usbserial or slab.
* Your port will look like: /dev/cu.usbserial-1410.

Linux
* Open the Terminal.
* Run the command: dmesg | grep tty
* Look for "attached to ttyUSB" at the bottom of the output.
* Your port will look like: /dev/ttyUSB0 or /dev/ttyUSB1.

### Run the code
Run the executable file that you made.  
In the Control Panel section type in the port and click attach.

## ToDo
* Live Graphs

* ~~Live Variables~~

## Work in progress Documentation
### Protocol Specifications

### Modify Packet
This is used to modify a value within the system

* [Format](https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html): <BH3s[f/I]I
    * B: packet id, used to specify type of action
    * H: Number of bytes contained in string data. For modify packet:3
    * [#]s: First byte will specify numeric data's type. F for float, I for integer,B for boolean. The next 2 byte will
      be the variable name to change
    * [f/I]: The actual numeric data specified by previous, boolean still uses I
    * I: checksum of 3s[f/I] data
